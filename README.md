# Foobar-BIU-mobile

To run the project, open it in Android Studio and click the "Run" button at the top (ctrl+f5).

## Workflow
At the start of the project, we sat down and planned the application structure, splitted the work between the three of us (Asif and Hodaya, and Michael) and created a sprint with the appropriate tasks on Jira. Afterwords we started working on the project, starting with the web application, and later moving on to the android application.

Originally, we splitted the work between the three of us pretty evenly. Unfortunately on the second week Michael fell very ill, which meant some of the work he was supposed to do had to be done by others. Towards the end of the project, after Michael got better, he also worked on the mobile application, altough less than Asif and Hodaya did.

Our workflow was: selecting a task assigned to me on Jira, working on it in my own branch, and then selecting another related task and working on it as well. After completing the work on a part of the application (for example having both the sign-in and sign-up pages ready), opened a pull request for review by the 2 other members. After everyone approves the pull request, one of us merges it into main.
